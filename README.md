Welcome to the Road Accidents Dashboard portfolio project. This project showcases my journey in data visualization and storytelling through Tableau. The main objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Tableau's features and tools while creating an insightful and informative dashboard.

## Project Overview
The Road Accidents Dashboard analyses and visualizes a dataset I found on YouTube. The dataset contains information about different types of accidents involving various modes of transportation. Additionally, it captures external factors and conditions contributing to these accidents. The dataset spans 2019 to 2022 and categorizes damage levels as serious, fatal, and slight.

## Visualization and Learning Experience
Throughout this project, I embarked on a journey of discovery and learning. The process of visualizing the dataset using Tableau allowed me to acquire a diverse set of skills and techniques. As a primary goal, I aimed to enhance my proficiency in utilizing the existing tools provided by Tableau.
## Dashboard Flexibility and Insights
The Road Accidents Dashboard is a testament to my dedication to data visualization. It offers flexibility in exploring various aspects of accidents, including time distribution, severity of damage, and critical statistical measures. By presenting this dashboard, I intended to provide a comprehensive overview of accident trends and their correlations with different variables.

## Conclusion
The Road Accidents Dashboard project has honed my Tableau skills and deepened my appreciation for the power of visual storytelling with data. I invite you to explore this dashboard and join me on a continuous learning and improvement journey. Your insights, feedback, and collaboration are highly valued as I strive to refine my abilities and create impactful data-driven narratives.
